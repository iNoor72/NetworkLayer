# NetworkLayer
A simple Network Layer built with Swift & URLSession :)

## Description
This is a light, simple, and powerful Swift Package that allows easy integration of the Network Layer to your iOS project. 

## Getting started
To use this package, you can simply add it to your packages in your iOS project from project's settings, or copy the following code into your Package.swift file:
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/iNoor72/NetworkLayer", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## How to use it
Using this package is simple, you're going to create an endpoint in your project as an Enum, import NetworkLayer package in the file, and then conform to the Endpoint protocol.
By conforming to the protocol, you're asked to fill in 3 required parameters from the protocol: baseURL, path, and method. You can make an extension on Endpoint protocol and provide some default values to these required parameters or any other parameters you would like.

Your endpoint enum simply would look like the following:

Of course, you can provide custom values for queryItems, headers, and parameters variables, as they are by default are set to "nil" in the Endpoint protocol extension in the package.
